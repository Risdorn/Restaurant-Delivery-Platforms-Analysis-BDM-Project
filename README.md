# A Data-Driven Analysis of Restaurant Delivery Platforms

> **Grade Letter: D**

This project was completed as part of the Business Data Management course. I chose the secondary approach for this project, which is why the maximum possible grade is a D in this approach. The project involved analyzing datasets to investigate various aspects of the restaurant delivery industry.

This project was developed as part of the Business Data Management (BDM) project from IITM. It focuses on analyzing restaurant delivery platforms to uncover valuable insights into customer preferences, competitive dynamics, and strategic opportunities for restaurant expansion.
